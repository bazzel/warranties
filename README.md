# warranties

This is an Ember front-end for [Warranties API](https://github.com/bazzel/warranties_api).

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)
* [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)
* [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome/)

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* `cd warranties`
* `npm install`

## Running / Development

* `ember serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
* Visit your tests at [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests).

### Code Generators

Make use of the many generators for code, try `ember help generate` for more details

### Running Tests

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

### Linting

* `npm run lint:hbs`
* `npm run lint:js`
* `npm run lint:js -- --fix`

### Building

* `ember build` (development)
* `ember build --environment production` (production)

### Deploying

The application is setup to deploy to Amazon S3 and (currently) connects to a back-end hosted on Heroku.

To deploy to your own S3 bucket:

* create and configure a bucket on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - [Ember Screencasts](https://www.emberscreencasts.com/tags/ember-cli-deploy) has some good instructions on this. 
* copy `env.example` to `.env`
* in `.env`, fill in your AWS access key, -secret, bucket and region
* deploy with `ember deploy production`

#### Connect to your own back-end

The current application uses an API hosted on Heroku. The host name for this is defined in [`config/environment.js`](config/environment.js) and can be replaced by your own.

Please consult [Warranties API](https://github.com/bazzel/warranties_api) for more information.
